# CISC191-DnD5eSpellTracker
8 week Java Project for CISC 191. A Spells Tracker for DnD5e

## Project Proposal
### Planned Working Time
I plan on working on this project after class on Mondays from 12:00pm to at least 3:00pm. I will also work on it as needed on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays.

### Project Pitch
(insert project pitchs)

### CRC Cards
(inset CRC Cards)

### UML Diagram
(insert UML Diagram)

### Object-Oriented Design
(link to video of object oriented design.)

### Learning Outcomes
- LO1: Employ design priniclepls of object-oriented programming
- LO2: Construct programs utilizing single and multidimensional arrays (optional)
- LO3: Construct programs utlizing object and classes in object-oriented programming, including aggregation
- LO4: Construct programs utlizing inheritance and polymorphism, including abstract classes and interfaces
- LO5: construct pograms utilizing genertic collections and data structures.
- LO6: Construct programs utilizing graphical user interdces and utilizing event-driven programming
- LO7: Construct programs utilizing exception handling
- LO8: Construct programs utilizing text file I/O

### Timeline
__Everyweek__
 - Updtae project page with the progress details.
 - Submit code written so far.

__Week 1__
 - Write the project proposal
 - Plan the object-oriented design, starting with CRC cards. Determine classes (with fields and methods) and interfaces and their responsiblites. (the "model" part of MVC.)
 - Create the UML.
 - Begin writing project page.

__Week 2__
 - Write code for classes X, Y, Z.
 - Develop text cases and test code as it is written.

__Week 3__
 - Finish writing classes.
 - Determine where exception handling is needed to ensure the program fails gracefully
 - Design th eGUI (sketch it out on paper) - include the design in the weekly update!

__Week 4__
 - Test, test, test, debug, and test some more.

__Week 5__
 - Write code to create a non-functional GUI (the "view" part of MVC.)

__Week 6__
 - Add event handling to make the GUI funcitonal (the "controller" part of MVC).

__Week 7__
 - Test, test, test, debug, and test some more

__Week 8__
 - Debug any remaining problems.
 - Create project demonstration video, including information about hwo each LO is used as part of the project.
 - Submit final code on Canvas, and add videos to project page.
